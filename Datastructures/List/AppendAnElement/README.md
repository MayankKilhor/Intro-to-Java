# Append without duplicates
## John is a teacher, he has assigned a roll number to each student in ascending order. Every time he assigns a number to a student, he wants to check whether the number is already assigned to any other student. This is to avoid duplicates in the roll number. Add a number to the list only if the number is not previously present. Implement this concept using a Linked List. If the list is empty, print "List is empty".
